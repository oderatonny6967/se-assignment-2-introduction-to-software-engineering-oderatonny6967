Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software Engineering is science that encompasses the systematic application of engineering principle, planning ,tools for the development ,implementation and maintainance of high quality software .
It differs from traditional programming in a way that it encompasses the entire planning ,reqirement analysis ,design ,implementation ,testing,deployment,maintatance while traditional programming focuses on implementation writing of coed to fulfil the requirements .



Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
    Requirements Analysis - Understanding the idea of what you want to do .
    Design - Creating a blue print of the idea you want to do and the functionnalities that will be executed .
    Implemetation - writing code to fulfil the requirements .
    Testing - ensure that the software works before the user access it .
    Deployment -  release the software to the user .
    Mainainance - fixing of bugs that arises .
                  Add new features that a software engineer might have think after deployment .





Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. 
   WaterFall
   Is a sequential model where each stage of the Software Development Life Cycle  must be completed before moving to the next stage . 
   Agile 
   Uses  an iterative and incremental approach Bto develop the software .Iterative means that it breaks down the process in small stages and an can incease the functionalities in each process.
What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
   Agile is iterative  while Waterfall is sequential and rigid.
   Agile delivers features in short cycles and incrementaal while Waterfall delivers the entire project at once.
   Agile emphasizes ongoing user  collaboration while Waterfall limits it to initial stages and final stages once the project is finished .
what scenarios might each be preferred:
  Agile 
   used when Functionalities anre unclear,dynamic and  a user feedback is needed .
   Used when the user is wants to be involved in the project .
   Used when the project is large.
  Waterfall
   Used when the project is small and has clear functionalities.
   when there is strict regulations to complete project .




Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering?
   Requiements Engineering is a process in Software Engineering that involves defining /identification,documentation, maintaining of needs of a software system.
Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
    R.E process
     -Elicitation
      This is the gathering stage ,includes gathering requirements from differnt stakeholders,users. 
     -Analysis 
      Analyze the gathered reqirements interms of feasibility analysis ,identification of key features ,identification of risks.
     -Specification
       Documentation f the requirements in a clear and precise manner .
       Creating a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.
     -Validation or Verification 
       The documented requirements are verified by the stakeholders and user of the system to ascetain that they are like the original .
     -Maintanance 
       This is the stage whre any changes that will occur will be handled ,Any update that would occur.           

     Its importance is to make sur that the final product that would have been developed should meet the stakeholders needs or spectations. 





Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design.
    Modularity is a design principle in software engineering that involves dividing the software system into independent with each module having  a specific responsibility. 
How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
     Maintainability 
      -Changes in one module have minimal impact on others, making it easier to update or fix bugs.
      -Individual modules can be tested independently, ensuring higher  quality and reliability.
     Scalability  
      -different modules can be worked on simultaneously, speeding up development.




Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing).
      unit testing
       -Testing of individuals components or units to ensure that they work as expected .
       -It includes testing a function ,code 
      integration testing
       -Combining individual components or units to ensure that they work as a group to perfoem as expected.
      system testing
       -Testing the complete software system .All the integrated components of the system are tested to meet the user specific requirements .
      acceptance testing
       -Final testing .Its is done t show whether the the system schives all the requirements .
Why is testing crucial in software development?
   To enaple the engineer  detect bugs and fix them.
   To ascertain that the requirements specificatin have been met .
   To see through a successful deployment .





Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? 
 Version control system(VCS) are tools in software development process during the implementation process of the SDLC they keep track of the code that is being written hence acts like a file code cabbinet for software engineers .
They are important tools becauese can be used for collaboration with other software engineer, act as a storage and tracking keeping field.

Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
  -Github
    features ;
     Pushing 
     Pulling   
     Braching
     Merging 
     forking 




Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. 
    -plans project and schedule 
    -Allow resources allocation based on their skills 
    -Cordinates and leads the team of engineer 
    -Identifies risks and develop mitigation stategies 
    -controls the whole project to completion .
What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
    -Finishing the project on time with all user requirements working 
    -Resource constraints .
    -Managing risks and mitigating them 
    -



Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities.
   Software maintainance is the process of software development cycle which include updating software systems after initial deployment .
      -Corrective Maintenance- fixing bugs and defects 
      -Adaptive Maintenance -for the software to work on new environment .
      -Perfective Maintenance- ADDING NEW FEATURES AND PERFECTING EXISTING FUNCTIONALIRIES 
      -preventive Maintenace -reduces the risk of future failure and improves code quality.

Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
    It is crucial since ; 
    -it leads to adapting the software to new environment
    -ensures that the software functions correctly .
    -Improves performance and add new features .




Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face?
    - Data privacy 
    -Intellectual property 
    -Software Quality 
    -Security and vulnerability 
How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

    -Use of proffesional code of conduct 
    -Data code of conduct 
    -Tramnsparent on communication
    -Prioritize security 
    -
